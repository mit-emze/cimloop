  # These histograms symmetric and zero-centered (the centermost bin is the
  # probability of zero). Histograms are normalized to sum to 1.0 and they have
  # 2^N-1 bins for some N. Encoding functions will upsample or downsample them
  # as needed to match the bitwidth of the corresponding operands.
